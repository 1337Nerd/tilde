# Tilde

Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)â€”the idea is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available commands, enter a `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

## Examples

```
a              # takes you to amazon.com
t: amazon      # searches Twitter for Amazon
g: twitter     # searches GitHub for Twitter
r: cats        # searches Reddit for cats
f              # takes you to facebook.com
cade scroggins # searches google for me
```

You get the idea...
