# Tilde

Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)â€”the idea is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites, press `enter`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

## Examples

```
t                # takes you to Twitter
u/new            # takes you to the new photos on Unsplash
r/r/unixporn     # takes you to the unixporn subreddit
a: zen mind      # searches Amazon for zen mind
cats             # searches Google for cats
```

You get the idea...
