I was inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages), and this is the result. The idea is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

**Usage:**

It's pretty simple. To go to a site you just enter the corresponding key. To view the available commands, enter a `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic google search will be triggered.

**Examples:**

```
a                # takes you to amazon.com
t: donald trump  # searches Twitter for Donald Trump
g: twitter       # searches GitHub for Twitter
f                # takes you to facebook.com
asdf             # searches google for asdf
```
